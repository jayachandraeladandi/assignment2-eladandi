# JAYACHANDRA SAI ELADANDI
I have done my undergraduation in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. In my final semester, I have done a mini project named Safety Helmet, which is very useful in mines and a major project about Automatic Speed Breaker, to follow the rules and to avoid accidents. Here I got interest towards technology and I planned to pursue my Masters in Computer Science.
